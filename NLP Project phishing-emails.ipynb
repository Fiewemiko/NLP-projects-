debated topic in romance linguistics as well as in theoretical syntax. its main bulk consists of a systematic inventory of agreement systems throughout romance ( chs. 3 - 4 ), which is unprecedented as to both empirical coverage and level of detail. beside the standard languages, dialects ( especially, but by no means exclusively, italo - romance ones ) are considered thoroughly, based in part on first - hand data. one of the basic points of this work is that no sensible account of pp agreement can be arrived at without in - depth consideration of dialect variation. more than sixty different systems are taken into account : for virtually all of them the discussion is not limited to selected syntactic constructions, but rather encompasses the whole set of verbal periphrastics ( both perfective and passive ) consisting of auxiliary + pp. among the agreement systems analyzed here several have not been previously described. the presentation of romance syntactic variation in chapters 3 and 4 is preceded by two introductory chapters and followed by three more theoretically oriented ones. ch. 1 deals with traditional accounts of pp agreement in romance linguistics and shows why a fresh look at the phenomena at issue is needed. ch. 2 introduces the aims and method of the present monograph, which is cast in the framework of relational grammar. after the assessment of dialect variation in pp agreement ( chs. 3 - 4 ), ch. 5 shows that the analysis developed to account for it naturally projects onto diachrony. the steps through which pp agreement has evolved over time from latin to romance are shown to closely match the parametric options evidenced by synchronic geographic variation. ch. 6 compares the achievements of the present study with competing approaches to pp agreement developed within the principles and parameters approach ( or earlier versions of generative grammar ). one of the main results of this comparison is the recognition of the fact that proposals put forward [SEP]\""]},"execution_count":24,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["tokenizer.decode(balanced_dataset['train'][0]['input_ids'])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Loading and training model"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":25,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-12T14:28:46.724343Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-12T14:28:46.722780Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-12T14:28:49.838948Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-12T14:28:49.838098Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-07-12T14:28:46.724305Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["Some weights of DistilBertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-cased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight', 'pre_classifier.bias', 'pre_classifier.weight']\n","You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.\n"]}],"source":["# LOADING AND TRAINING MODEEL\n","\n","model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\n","    \"distilbert-base-cased\", num_labels=2,\n","    output_attentions = False, # Whether the model returns attentions weights.\n","    output_hidden_states = False # Whether the model returns all hidden-states.\n",")\n","\n","model.config.id2label = {0: 'SAVE EMAIL', 1: 'PHISHING EMAIL'}\n","#The message \"You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it\n","#for predictions and inference\" is suggesting that you should fine-tune this model on your\n","#specific task (phishing email detection in this case) before using it for predictions or inference"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":26,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-12T14:28:49.845408Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-12T14:28:49.843024Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-12T14:28:49.855329Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-12T14:28:49.854388Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-07-12T14:28:49.845371Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["65.783042\n"]}],"source":["# number of trainable parameters\n","print(model.num_parameters(only_trainable=True)/1e6)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":27,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-12T14:28:49.861787Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-12T14:28:49.858391Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-12T14:28:50.353143Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-12T14:28:50.352091Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-07-12T14:28:49.861752Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/var/folders/np/t6zn6slj5yx_33m6c396sq0m0000gq/T/ipykernel_66210/1239220452.py:3: FutureWarning: load_metric is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version of datasets.
